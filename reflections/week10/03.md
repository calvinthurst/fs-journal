## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
a row represents a single entry in the table and contains all the information for a single item  a column represents a single piece of data within a row and contains the same type of data for each row.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE characters (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
DELETE deletes the contents of a table and DROP gets rid of a whole table
