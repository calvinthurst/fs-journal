## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value types: These types directly contain their data and are stored on the stack
Reference types: These types store a reference to the data, which is stored on the heap
Pointer types: Pointers are used to directly manipulate memory and are typically used in low-level programming 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
The main difference is that C# has a distinction between value types and reference types, while JavaScript does not.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Value types are stored directly on the stack and have a fixed size, while Reference types are stored on the heap and accessed through a reference
